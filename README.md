# google-homepage
replica google homepage for the odin project


# grid-layout branch
I started with grid layout but got lost in the weeds, WIP.

This is intended to solidify the basic HTML/CSS skills just learned in the first section of the Web Development 101 course on The Odin Project.

Goal: Replica Google homepage, fully responsive, including functional search and results page (queries will still go through actual Google)
